# GENERATED — the source of this file lives in virajp/claude-status at
# `.config/homebrew/claude-status.rb`. Edit it there, not in the tap.
#
# `release.yml`'s `bump-tap` job rewrites `url` and `sha256` for the release it
# has just published and writes this whole file into virajp/homebrew-tap. The
# tap's copy is overwritten in full every release, so it cannot drift, and the
# first release creates it — there is no formula to seed by hand.
#
# The whole formula lives in the source repository rather than a two-field patch
# against a copy in the tap because `desc`, `homepage`, `caveats` and the
# `depends_on` pair would otherwise exist only in the tap, where nothing in the
# project's test suite can see them.
#
# `url` and `sha256` are a real released pair rather than placeholders, so this
# file is a formula `brew style` and `brew audit` can check wherever it sits.

  # No `version`. Homebrew scans it out of the url, and a `version` line beside
  # a version-bearing url is a hard `brew audit` failure.

  # `ArchRequirement` is `fatal true`, so an Intel Mac is refused with "The
  # arm64 architecture is required for this software." rather than installing
  # something that cannot run. `depends_on :macos` handles the Linux half.
  # `arch` before `macos` — `FormulaAudit/DependencyOrder` enforces the order.

    # block. The overwrite warning belongs here because this is the last text a
    # user reads before running the command that does it.

      Run `claude-status --configure` to wire this into Claude Code.
      This OVERWRITES any existing status line in ~/.claude/settings.json.
